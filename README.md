# grass_flowering_ML
Machine learning models to identify whether images of North American prairie grasses show flowering, judged by the presence of live anthers. Images obtained from the citizen science repository iNaturalist. Species of interest: switchgrass, big bluestem, and Indiangrass.

Two main methods were tried: [image classification](https://github.com/LTibbs/grass_flowering_ML/tree/main/image_classification) and [image detection](https://github.com/LTibbs/grass_flowering_ML/tree/main/anther_detection).
